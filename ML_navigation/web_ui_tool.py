Open WebUI Tool: VS Code Script Executor

This module defines a custom tool intended for integration with Open WebUI. It provides a method
to remotely execute Python or shell commands in a VS Code environment via a Flask server
(e.g., inside a Docker container).

It streams the output live to the WebUI interface using an asynchronous event emitter.

üîß To implement this tool in Open WebUI:
1. Add this script to the `tools/` directory of your WebUI instance.
2. Register `Tools` as an available tool in the system configuration.
3. Ensure the corresponding Flask server is running and listening at HOST_SERVER_URL.

Requirements:
- A Flask backend at `http://host.docker.internal:5000` with `/run-script` endpoint.
- Open WebUI environment with support for async tools and streaming.

        Sends a command to a Flask-based script executor running in VS Code and streams output.

        This function is meant to be used from Open WebUI as a tool. It posts a command to an HTTP
